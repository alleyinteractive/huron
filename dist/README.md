# Distribution directory

This directory contains the Huron source code that will be distributed via NPM. If you are developing for Huron, you must run the `npm run build` script before pushing and/or merging your changes. This script will run the source code through `eslint`, using the [airbnb standards](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), and `babel`.
